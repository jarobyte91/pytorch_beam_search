      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As the first edition of Edward Laskcr's CHESS STRATEGY was\n",
      "exhausted within a comparatively short time of its appearance,\n",
      "the author set himself the task of altering and improving the\n",
      "work to such an extent that it became to all intents and purposes\n",
      "a new book. I had the privilege of co-operating with him to a\n",
      "slight degree on that second edition, and was in consequence able\n",
      "to appreciate the tremendous amount of work he voluntarily took\n",
      "upon himself to do; I say voluntarily, because his publishers,\n",
      "anxious to supply the strong demand for the book, wished to\n",
      "reprint it as it stood.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little later I undertook to translate this second edition into\n",
      "English for Messrs. Bell & Sons. Only a few months had elapsed,\n",
      "the tournaments at Petrograd, Chester, and Mannheim had taken\n",
      "place, several new discoveries had been made, and it is the\n",
      "greatest testimony to Edward Lasker's indefatigable devotion to\n",
      "the Art of Chess that I am able to say that this is not a\n",
      "translation of the second edition, but of what is practically a\n",
      "new book. It contains a new preface, a chapter for beginners, a\n",
      "new introduction, new variations.  Furthermore, a large number of\n",
      "new games have taken the place of old ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no doubt that any chess player who will take the trouble\n",
      "to study CHESS STRATEGY will spend many a pleasurable hour.\n",
      "Incidentally new vistas will be opened to him, and his playing\n",
      "strength increased to a surprising degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author says in his preface that he appeals to the\n",
      "intelligence and not the memory of his readers. In my opinion,\n",
      "too, the student should above all try to improve his judgment of\n",
      "position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Than the playing over of games contested by experts I can hardly\n",
      "imagine a greater or purer form of enjoyment.  Yet I must at the\n",
      "outset sound a note of warning against its being done\n",
      "superficially, and with a feverish expectation of something\n",
      "happening. Every move or combination of moves should be carefully\n",
      "weighed, and the student should draw his own conclusions and\n",
      "compare them with what actually happens in the game under\n",
      "examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "This applies particularly to some of the critical positions set\n",
      "out in diagrams in the course of the exposition of the several\n",
      "games.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader would derive the greatest possible benefit from a\n",
      "prolonged study of such positions before seeking to know how the\n",
      "games proceed. After having formed his own opinion about the\n",
      "merits of a particular position, he should compare the result\n",
      "with the sequel in the game in question, and thus find out where\n",
      "his judgment has been at fault.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deeper study of the theory of the openings is of course a\n",
      "necessity to the student who wishes to become an expert, but the\n",
      "development of his judgment must precede it. To him Griffith &\n",
      "White's admirable book, Modern Chess Openings, will be a perfect\n",
      "mine of information. There are thousands of variations, and in\n",
      "most of them the actual game in which they were first tried by\n",
      "masters is named, thus adding to the interest and value of the\n",
      "work.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must not omit to mention the invaluable help afforded me by my\n",

      "AUTHOR'S PREFACE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "THE large majority of chess players who would like to improve\n",
      "their game, have not the necessary opportunity of pitting\n",
      "themselves against players of master-strength, or at least of\n",
      "obtaining the desired instruction from personal intercourse with\n",
      "them. It is for such players that the present work is intended.\n",
      "The books on which the learner has to rely hardly ever serve his\n",
      "purpose, being mostly little more than a disjointed tabulation of\n",
      "numberless opening variations, which cannot be understood without\n",
      "preliminary studies, and consequently only make for confusion. In\n",
      "the end the connection between the various lines of play may\n",
      "become clear, after the student has made an exhaustive study of\n",
      "the subject, but very few would have either the time or the\n",
      "inclination for such prolonged labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore another shorter and less empirical way must be found in\n",
      "which to acquire the understanding of sound play. My system of\n",
      "teaching differs from the usual ones, in that it sets down at the\n",
      "outset definite elementary principles of chess strategy by which\n",
      "any move can be gauged at its true value, thus enabling the\n",
      "learner to form his own judgment as to the manoeuvres under\n",
      "consideration. In my opinion it is absolutely ESSENTIAL to follow\n",
      "such strategical principles, and I go so far as to assert that\n",
      "such principles are in themselves SUFFICIENT for the development\n",
      "and conduct of a correct game of chess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though instruction in chess is possible on very general\n",
      "lines alone, yet I think it advisable and indeed necessary to\n",
      "explain the application of such principles to the various phases\n",
      "of each game of chess. Otherwise the learner might unduly delay\n",
      "his progress, and lose valuable time in finding out for himself\n",
      "certain essentials that could more profitably be pointed out to\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to the way in which I have arranged my subject and\n",
      "the form of its exposition in detail, I have thought out the\n",
      "following plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "After discussing at length the leading principles underlying\n",
      "sound play, I have first treated of the OPENINGS, in which such\n",
      "principles are of even more deciding influence than in any other\n",
      "stage of the game, as far as could be done on broad lines without\n",
      "having to pay attention to middle and end-game considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I proceeded as follows, by taking as my starting-point the  \"pawn\n",
      "skeleton\" which is formed in the opening, and round which the\n",
      "pieces should group themselves in logical fashion.  As a\n",
      "consequence of the pawns having so little mobility, this  \"pawn\n",
      "skeleton\" often preserves its shape right into the end-game.\n",
      "Applying the general strategical principles to the formation of\n",
      "the pawn skeleton, the learner acquires the understanding of the\n",
      "leading idea underlying each opening without having to burden his\n",
      "memory. Not only that, he will also be able to find a correct\n",
      "plan of development when confronted with unusual forms of\n",
      "opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important result of this system of teaching is that the\n",
      "learner does not lose his way in a maze of detail, but has in\n",
      "view at the very outset, the goal which the many possible\n",
      "variations of the openings are intended to reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I could proceed to the discussion of the middle game, I\n",
      "found it necessary to treat of the principles governing the END-\n",
      "GAME. For in most cases play in the middle game is influenced by\n",
      "end-game considerations. Here also it has been my endeavour as\n",
      "far as possible to reduce my subject to such principles as are\n",
      "generally applicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, as regards the MIDDLE GAME, to which the whole of Part\n",
      "II is devoted, I have again made the handling of pawns, the\n",
      "hardest of all problems of strategy, the starting-point for my\n",
      "deliberations. I have shown at length how the various plans\n",
      "initiated by the various openings should be developed further. To\n",
      "ensure a thorough understanding of the middle game, I have given\n",
      "a large number of games taken from master play, with numerous and\n",
      "extensive notes. Thus the student has not to rely only on\n",
      "examples taken haphazard from their context, but he will at the\n",
      "same time see how middle-game positions, which give opportunities\n",
      "for special forms of attack, are evolved from the opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been my desire to make the subject easily understandable\n",
      "and at the same time entertaining, and to appeal less to the\n",
      "memory of my readers than to their common sense and intelligence.\n",
      "I hope in that way not to have strayed too far from the ideal I\n",
      "had in mind when writing this book, namely, to apply to chess the\n",
      "only method of teaching which has proved productive in all\n",
      "branches of science and art, that is, the education of individual\n",

      "A GAME of chess is played by two opponents on a square board\n",
      "consisting of sixty-four White and Black squares arranged\n",
      "alternately. The forces on each side comprise sixteen units,\n",
      "namely a King, a Queen, two Rooks, two Bishops, two Knights, and\n",
      "eight Pawns. All units move according to different laws, and the\n",
      "difference in their mobility is the criterion of their relative\n",
      "value and of the fighting power they contribute towards achieving\n",
      "the ultimate aim, namely, the capture of the opposing King.\n",
      "Before I can explain what is meant by the capture of the King, I\n",
      "must set out the rules of the game in full.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagram 1 shows the position the forces take up for the contest.\n",
      "The board is so placed that there is a white square at the top\n",
      "left-hand corner. The Rooks take up their positions at the corner\n",
      "squares, and next to them the Knights.  Next to those again are\n",
      "the Bishops, and in the centre the King and Queen, the White\n",
      "Queen on a White square, and the Black Queen on a Black square.\n",
      "The eight pawns occupy the ranks immediately in front of the\n",
      "pieces. From this initial position, White begins the game in\n",
      "which the players must move alternately.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pieces move in the following way: The Rook can move from any\n",
      "square it happens to be on, to any other square which it can\n",
      "reach in a straight line, either perpendicularly or horizontally,\n",
      "unless there is another piece of the same colour in the way, in\n",
      "which case it can only move as far as the square immediately in\n",
      "front of that piece. If it is an opposing piece which blocks the\n",
      "way, he can move on to the square that piece occupies, thereby\n",
      "capturing it. The piece thus captured is removed from the board.\n",
      "The Bishop can operate along either of the diagonals of which the\n",
      "square on which he is standing forms part. A Bishop on a White\n",
      "square can there fore never get on to a Black one.\n",

      "game to become thoroughly conversant with it. The original and\n",
      "earliest notation is still in use in English, French, and Spanish\n",
      "speaking countries. It is derived from the original position in\n",
      "the game, in that the squares take the names of the pieces which\n",
      "occupy them. Thus the corner squares are called R 1 (Rook's\n",
      "square or Rook's first), and to distinguish them from one another\n",
      "QR1 or KR 1 (Queen's or King's Rook's square). The squares\n",
      "immediately in front are called QR2 or KR2. A distinction is made\n",
      "between White and Black, and White's R 1 is Black's R 8, Black's\n",
      "R 2 is White's R 7, White's K B 3 is Black's KB6, and so on. K\n",
      "stands for King; Q for Queen; B for Bishop; Kt for Knight; R for\n",

      "this notation it is necessary to bear in mind which Kt is the Q\n",
      "Kt, which R is the KR. This becomes increasingly difficult as the\n",
      "game goes on and pieces change their places.  Many sets of\n",

      "the chess-board and military operations in actual warfare. In\n",
      "trying to seek such analogies there is great danger of being led\n",
      "astray, and little likelihood of gaining knowledge that might be\n",
      "of use in practical play. Plain common-sense will give us all we\n",
      "need, without our being influenced by those tactical and\n",
      "strategical considerations that have been found useful in war.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following definition may not be out of place: Strategy sets\n",
      "down the whole of the problems which must be solved in war, in\n",
      "order to attain the ultimate result aimed at; tactics solve such\n",
      "problems in various ways, and according to the conditions\n",
      "prevailing in the particular case. Sound strategy, when setting\n",

      "only a thorough knowledge of tactical resources makes correct\n",
      "strategy possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we shall not under any circumstances, as unfortunately even\n",
      "great chess masters have done, seek in outward similarities\n",
      "justification for transferring to chess the teachings of the\n",
      "strategy and tactics of war. It sounds pretty enough to say:\n",
      "Chess is a game of war--the various pieces represent the various\n",
      "kinds of forces: the pawns represent the infantry, the Knights\n",
      "take the place of cavalry, the Rooks do the work of heavy\n",
      "artillery, sweeping broad lines; the different ways in which the\n",
      "pieces move find a parallel in the topography of the theatre of\n",
      "war, in that the various battle-fields are more or less easy of\n",
      "access. But it is quite unjustifiable to assign to the Knights\n",
      "the functions of scouts, and to say that Rooks should stay in the\n",
      "background, as heavy artillery, and so on. Such pronouncements\n",
      "would not have the slightest practical value.  What we take from\n",
      "the science of warfare is merely the definition. In each game the\n",
      "strategy of chess should set us the tasks which must be\n",
      "accomplished (in order to mate the opponent's King), and tactics\n",
      "point the way in which it is possible to solve such problems.\n",
      "Correct chess strategy will only set such tasks as are tactically\n",
      "possible, and, if we wish to expound the principles of chess\n",
      "strategy, we cannot exclude chess tactics from the field of our\n",

      "In the first chapter, when considering special cases in\n",
      "elementary combinations, we have already noticed the important\n",
      "part played in each skirmish by the balance between the attacking\n",
      "and defending units. Speaking quite generally, common-sense will\n",
      "tell us that, in all operations on the chess-board, the main\n",
      "consideration for the defence will be to maintain that balance,\n",
      "and that there is only justification for an attack when it is\n",
      "possible to concentrate more forces on the strategic point than\n",
      "can be mustered by the defence. However, one very important point\n",
      "must not be neglected, though I did not touch upon it when\n",
      "discussing elementary combinations for fear of complicating\n",
      "matters for beginners: the balance between the contending forces\n",
      "is by no means established by their numerical equality. A\n",
      "paramount factor is the mobility of such forces, and as soon as\n",
      "it is no longer one of the elementary cases of capture and\n",
      "recapture described previously, this factor must be taken into\n",
      "account in order to decide, on a general survey, whether there is\n",
      "a sufficient defence to an impending attack, or whether one's own\n",
      "intended attack is likely to prevail. That mobility is the first\n",
      "and foremost consideration should be self-evident, since the\n",
      "relative value of the pieces can only make itself felt by their\n",
      "greater or lesser mobility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except in certain positions, which are brought about by some\n",

      "Knight and Bishop are considered equivalent, because the Knight's\n",

      "facilitating the favourable development of pieces. But when\n",
      "considering the form of a pawn position and that of the pieces,\n",
      "we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that pawn formation must\n",
      "necessarily be the dominant consideration in our mind. Pawn\n",
      "formation is of a more permanent character than that of the\n",
      "pieces, in consequence of the latter's greater mobility. When we\n",
      "have made a rash move with a piece, to which our attacking\n",
      "disposition may have tempted us, we may still have a chance of\n",
      "retrieving the position by timely retreat. Once a pawn has moved\n",
      "it cannot turn back, and only after the greatest deliberation\n",
      "should we embark on changes in our pawn formation in order not to\n",
      "disturb the balance of this \"static element\" of the game. But we\n",
      "shall see that the pawn skeleton which was formed in the opening\n",
      "often weathers the storm and stress of the middle game, and\n",
      "frequently preserves its character right up to the end-game.  I\n",

      "basis of general strategical principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "If our pawn skeleton is to promote the freedom of all the pieces,\n",
      "we must not build it up with the narrow view of developing minor\n",
      "pieces only, but must consider from the very first in which way\n",
      "it will enable the Rooks to get into action. We can unite these\n",
      "tendencies in making the CENTRE OF THE BOARD the main field of\n",
      "action for all our forces. This means for both sides K4 and Q4,\n",
      "and also in a lesser degree QB4 and KB4.  We shall get a clear\n",
      "insight into the positional advantage of having command of the\n",
      "centre later on, when discussing the middle game. At present I\n",

      "elementary form, which will be sufficient to develop an\n",
      "understanding for pawn strategy in the opening. In the course of\n",
      "further deductions, after the grasp of this difficult stage of\n",
      "the game has become stronger, I will go into details which will\n",
      "allow the subject to be stated in a more precise form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Placing the pieces in the centre is of value, because there they\n",
      "have more mobility than near the edge, which, of course, limits\n",
      "their range of action, and also because from the centre a\n",
      "concentration of forces on a given point can generally be\n",
      "effected in the quickest way.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most cases two centre squares become inaccessible at once,\n",
      "through the opponent placing one of his pawns in the centre;\n",
      "therefore it would seem a good plan to lure that pawn away, and\n",
      "this is rendered feasible by playing P-K4 or P-QB4 when the\n",
      "opponent has a pawn on his Q4, and P-Q4 or P-KB4 when he has a\n",
      "pawn on K4. In the following we will consider such manoeuvres as\n",
      "could apply either to White or Black, from the point of view of\n",
      "White, to whom the initiative is, as pointed out above, a sort of\n",

      "instance, 1. P-K4, P-K4; 2. Kt-KB3, Kt-QB3; 3. P-QR3? the\n",
      "position is reversed, and Black is bound to obtain the initiative\n",
      "which is White's birthright.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pawn moves mentioned above also have the tendency of giving\n",
      "the Rooks an opportunity for action. A Rook standing behind an\n",
      "advanced pawn may support its further advance, or, if the pawn\n",
      "should be exchanged, might get an open file.\n",
      "\n",
      "The damage we wish to inflict on our opponent we must, of course,\n",
      "try to avoid ourselves. Thus we will not easily give up a centre\n",
      "pawn unless we can obtain some other advantage in doing so. This\n",
      "advantage may be, that in exchanging the centre pawn we open up\n",
      "lines of attack for our pieces, or that we are able to place one\n",
      "of our pieces in a commanding position in the centre of the\n",
      "board.\n",
