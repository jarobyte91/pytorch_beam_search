# Examples

This folder contains several use cases for the library. The idea is to give self-contained pipelines that show how to use the library in notebooks. Each example has its own data and pre-trained checkpoints to try the models.

Examples so far:

* **Character-level Language modelling** - This is the classical NLP task of training a probabilistic sequence model to assign probabilities to strings of characters. The folder has implementations of this task with autoregressive models.

* **Word-level Language modelling** - This is the classical NLP task of training a probabilistic sequence model to assign probabilities to strings of words. The folder has implementations of this task with autoregressive models.

* **Machine Translation** - This is the task of translating a sentence from one language to another. The folder has implementations with seq2seq models.
