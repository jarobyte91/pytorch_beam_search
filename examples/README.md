# Examples

This folder contains several use cases for the library. The idea is to give self-contained architectures in .py files and show how to use them in notebooks. Each example has its own data and checkpoints to try the models.

Examples so far:

* Language modelling - This is the classic NLP task of training a probabilistic sequence model to assign probabilities to strings of text. This can be accomplished with autoregressive models and Seq2Seq models.
