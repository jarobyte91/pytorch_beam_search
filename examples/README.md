# Examples

This folder contains several use cases for the library. The idea is to give self-contained architectures that extend the main classes (seq2seq and autoregressive in base.py) in .py files and show how to use them in notebooks. Each example has its own data and checkpoints to try the models.

Examples so far:

* Language modelling - This is the classic NLP task of training a probabilistic sequence model to assign probabilities to strings of text. The folder has implementations of this task with autoregressive models and Seq2Seq models.
